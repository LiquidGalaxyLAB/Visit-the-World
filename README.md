 ### __Welcome, know a little more about the project__

Visit the world is a project developed for GSoC 2021. Its main purpose is to help older people who do not have much knowledge of technology to navigate the world through Google Earth using only simple voice commands.

Developed using the LattePanda platform, a small development board with embedded Linux Ubuntu 18.04, a default installation of Google Earth Pro and scripts specially developed for speech detection and recognition and designed to control Google Earth navigation in several different ways.

It can also control a standard Liquid Galaxy installation by simply being connected to the same network as the Liquid Galaxy system.

The project is designed for installation on the LattePanda board, but it can also be installed on conventional computers and also on virtual machines, as long as they have Ubuntu 18.04 as the operating system
